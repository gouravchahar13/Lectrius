# Contributing to Lectrius

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Lectrius! It's people like you that make Lectrius such a great tool for the EV community. Here are some guidelines that we ask contributors to follow to make the process as smooth as possible.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a GitHub account.
- Submit an issue if there is something you want to work on.
- Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually main).
- Make commits of logical units.
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).

## Commit Messages

Your commit messages should start with a brief subject line that describes what the commit changes. Use the imperative mood in the subject line. Here's an example:


## Submitting Changes

- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to the original repository.
- Update your GitHub issue to mark that you have submitted code and are ready for it to be reviewed (include a link to the pull request).

## Code Review

- All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.
- We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.
